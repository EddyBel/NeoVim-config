This repository contains my custom configuration for Neovim, an advanced text editor that can be turned into a powerful integrated development environment (IDE). With my configuration, Neovim becomes a virtually full-featured IDE, supporting multiple programming languages and offering a smooth and agile user experience thanks to the use of the **[Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)** plugin manager. You'll find everything you need to start working with Neovim right away, from installing plugins to customizing keyboard shortcuts and display options - enjoy the productivity Neovim has to offer!.

## ðŸ˜¸ Why ?

This repository was created to share my custom configuration of Neovim, an advanced text editor that I have used for a long time for my daily programming work. I have spent many hours customizing and refining my configuration to make Neovim perfectly suited to my needs, and I think other programmers could benefit from it.

## ðŸ”¨ Requirements

In order to be able to use the code editor correctly, it is necessary to have some programs previously installed.

- [Neovim >= 0.5.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [NerdFonts (Recommended source: FiraCode Nerd Font)](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [C++](./docs/Instalar%20compilador%20de%20C%2B%2B.md)

## ðŸ¦‰ Features

- [x] Support for multiple programming languages (Syntax coloring, Code auto-completion, Snippets)
- [x] Commands to quickly execute and compile code.
- [x] Visually pleasing and developer friendly interface.
- [x] Useful information for the status bar.
- [x] Convenient keyboard shortcuts based on the standard of other IDEs like VSCode.

### âš™ LSP configuration

LSP clients are automatically installed at startup of neovim, this makes the installation work easier but you may not need all the languages, you can modify the `ensure_installed` line of the [mason.lua](./lua/plugins/mason.lua) file, delete or comment out the clients you do not need.

You can also change, add or remove LSP clients for each language, the settings for this can be found in the [lsp.lua](./lua/plugins/lsp.lua) file and can be guided in the settings of the [lsp-config](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) plugin. You can also install the clients with the [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) plugin, you can use the `:Mason` command or add it to the `ensure_installed` line in [mason.lua](./lua/plugins/mason.lua).

## ðŸ›  Configurations

The editor has some settings that can be useful and quick to configure, these are found in the [globals.lua](./lua/globals.lua) file, and are global variables that are used throughout the deeper configuration of the plugins.

## ðŸ“¦ Additional functions

The editor has some additional commands for different proportions, here is a list of the available commands.

| COMMAND                      | FUNCTION                                                                                                                                        |

## ðŸ§ª How to install

Once you have fulfilled the necessary requirements for the correct functioning of the configuration, you can proceed to the installation of this configuration.

1. The first thing is to clone the configuration repository this can be done with git or download it directly from github. to clone it with git you can use this command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EddyBel/Neovim.Config.git
   ```

2. Next is to move to the cloned repository folder once there you must copy the files `init.lua`, `lazy-lock.json` and finally the `lua` folder, these must go in your neovim configuration folder, for Linux systems you can use `~/.config/nvim`, for Windows you can use `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\nvim` or wherever neovim defines the configuration path.

   _Linux_

   ```bash
   cd Neovim.Config
   cp init.lua lazy-lock.json lua ~/.config/nvim
   ```

   _Windows_

   ```sh
   cd Neovim.Config
   xcopy init.lua lazy-lock.json lua C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\nvim /s /e /i
   ```

3. Before opening neovim it is important to install the code formatters, these will allow your code to maintain a good structure and design, for this we use the [Neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat) plugin to manage the formatters but we must install them separately with the following commands:

   ##### [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

   ```bash
   npm install -g prettier
   ```

   ##### [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)

   ```bash
   pip install black
   ```

   ##### [Clang-format](https://pypi.org/project/clang-format/)

   ```bash
   pip install clang-format
   ```

4. Finally you can open the editor with the command `nvim` and lazy will install all the plugins automatically, and that's it! you can start coding.

## ðŸŽ¢ Project status

The project is constantly changing because it is my usual code editor and I will be improving and adding things as I see fit.
