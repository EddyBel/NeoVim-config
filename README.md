This repository contains my custom configuration for Neovim, an advanced text editor that can be turned into a powerful integrated development environment (IDE). With my configuration, Neovim becomes a virtually full-featured IDE, supporting multiple programming languages and offering a smooth and agile user experience thanks to the use of the **[Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)** plugin manager. You'll find everything you need to start working with Neovim right away, from installing plugins to customizing keyboard shortcuts and display options - enjoy the productivity Neovim has to offer!.

## ðŸ˜¸ Why ?

This repository was created to share my custom configuration of Neovim, an advanced text editor that I have used for a long time for my daily programming work. I have spent many hours customizing and refining my configuration to make Neovim perfectly suited to my needs, and I think other programmers could benefit from it.

## ðŸ”¨ Requirements

In order to be able to use the code editor correctly, it is necessary to have some programs previously installed.

- [Neovim >= 0.5.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [NerdFonts (Recommended source: FiraCode Nerd Font)](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  <!-- - [Go](https://go.dev/) -->
  <!-- - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) -->
- [C++](./docs/Instalar%20compilador%20de%20C%2B%2B.md)

## ðŸ¦‰ Features

- [x] Support for multiple programming languages (Syntax coloring, Code auto-completion, Snippets)
- [x] Commands to quickly execute and compile code.
- [x] Visually pleasing and developer friendly interface.
- [x] Useful information for the status bar.
- [x] Convenient [keyboard shortcuts](./docs/KeyboardShortcuts.md) based on the standard of other IDEs like VSCode.

### âš— Install LSP Clients

It is important to mention that not all languages will be installed automatically, this is done to improve the performance of the configuration and each person can decide which languages he/she needs.

By default the most common languages `javascript`, `typescript`, `html`, `css`, `json`, `markdown`, `python`, `lua` will be installed, the other languages can be installed using the command `:Mason` and look for the name of the LSP client already configured for the language you need.

Another option is to modify the `LSP_CLIENTS` variable found in [globals.lua](./lua/globals.lua), here you can add the names of the servers you need and the Mason plugin will install them if they are not already installed.

### âš™ LSP configuration

You can also change, add or remove LSP clients for each language, the settings for this can be found in the [lsp.lua](./lua/plugins/lsp.lua) file and can be guided in the settings of the [lsp-config](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) plugin.
You can also install the clients with the [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) plugin, you can use the `:Mason` command or add it to the `LSP_CLIENTS` line in [globals.lua](./lua/globals.lua).

## ðŸ›  Configurations

The editor has some settings that can be useful and quick to configure, these are found in the [globals.lua](./lua/globals.lua) file, and are global variables that are used throughout the deeper configuration of the plugins.

## ðŸ§ª How to install

### Fast installation

Once you have the above requirements you can proceed to install the configuration.

1. The first thing is to have all the code formatters you like such as `Prettier`, `Black`, `Clang-format`, etc. installed on your system.
   You can install them through the mason plugin by running the `:Mason` command and searching for the formatter of your choice but I recommend installing them independently.

2. Then you can install the configuration using the following command depending on your environment.

   _Windows_

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/EddyBel/Neovim.Config.git $HOME\AppData\Local\nvim --depth 1 && nvim
   ```

   _Linux_ / _Macos_

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EddyBel/Neovim.Config.git ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim
   ```

   This command will clone the latest version of the repository in the configuration path of neovim, once cloned, neovim will be opened with the `nvim` command so that lazy proceeds with the installation of all plugins.

### Step by step installation

Once you have fulfilled the necessary requirements for the correct functioning of the configuration, you can proceed to the installation of this configuration.

1. The first thing is to clone the configuration repository this can be done with git or download it directly from github. to clone it with git you can use this command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EddyBel/Neovim.Config.git
   ```

2. Next is to move to the cloned repository folder once there you must copy the files `init.lua`, `lazy-lock.json` and finally the `lua` folder, these must go in your neovim configuration folder, for Linux systems you can use `~/.config/nvim`, for Windows you can use `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\nvim` or wherever neovim defines the configuration path.

   _Windows_

   ```sh
   cd Neovim.Config
   xcopy init.lua lazy-lock.json lua C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\nvim /s /e /i
   ```

   _Linux_ / _Macos_

   ```bash
   cd Neovim.Config
   cp init.lua lazy-lock.json lua ~/.config/nvim
   ```

3. Before opening neovim it is important to install the code formatters, these will allow your code to maintain a good structure and design, for this we use the [Neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat) plugin to manage the formatters but we must install them separately with the following commands:

   ##### [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

   ```bash
   npm install -g prettier
   ```

   ##### [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)

   ```bash
   pip install black
   ```

   ##### [Clang-format](https://pypi.org/project/clang-format/)

   ```bash
   pip install clang-format
   ```

4. Finally you can open the editor with the command `nvim` and lazy will install all the plugins automatically, and that's it! you can start coding.
